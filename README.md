# DataStructures-java

Java implementations of fundamental data structures, focusing on
Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL Tree.

## 📚 About the Project

This repository contains academic implementations of classic tree-based
data structures using Java. The goal is to understand and demonstrate:

- Tree insertion
- Node removal
- Tree traversal algorithms
- Self-balancing mechanisms (AVL rotations)

These implementations were developed for learning and practicing
Data Structures concepts.

## 🌳 Implemented Structures

### 🔹 Binary Search Tree (BST)

A tree structure where:
- Left subtree contains values smaller than the node
- Right subtree contains values greater than the node

Implemented features:
- Insertion
- Removal
- Search
- Tree traversals

---

### 🔹 AVL Tree

A self-balancing Binary Search Tree where:
- The height difference between left and right subtrees
  is at most 1
- Rotations are performed automatically after insertions
  and removals to maintain balance

Implemented features:
- Insertion with rebalancing
- Removal with rebalancing
- Rotations (Left, Right, Left-Right, Right-Left)
- Tree traversals
