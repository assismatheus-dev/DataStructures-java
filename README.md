# DataStructures-java

Java implementations of fundamental data structures.

## About the Project

This repository contains academic implementations of classic data structures using Java.  
The goal is to understand and demonstrate core concepts such as:

- Linear and hierarchical structures
- Insertion and removal operations
- Search algorithms
- Tree traversals
- Self-balancing mechanisms (AVL rotations)

These implementations were developed for learning and practicing
Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Implemented Structures

### Stack

- LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure  
- `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`

---

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

A tree structure where:

- Left subtree contains values smaller than the node  
- Right subtree contains values greater than the node  

Features:

- Insertion  
- Removal  
- Search  
- Tree traversals  

---

### AVL Tree

A self-balancing Binary Search Tree where:

- The height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1  
- Rotations are automatically performed to maintain balance  

Features:

- Insertion with rebalancing  
- Removal with rebalancing  
- Rotations (Left, Right, Left-Right, Right-Left)  
- Tree traversals

## Technologies Used

- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Purpose

This repository is part of my continuous study of Data Structures,
focusing on implementation details and understanding how each structure works internally.
