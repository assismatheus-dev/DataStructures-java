# LinkedQueue (Java)
Simple implementation of the Queue data structure using linked nodes in Java.

## Operations
- `enqueue()` – adds an element to the end of the queue
- `dequeue()` – removes and returns the first element
- `peek()` – returns the first element without removing it
- `isEmpty()` – checks if the queue is empty
- `size()` – returns the number of elements

## Concept
Follows the FIFO principle (First In, First Out).
Implemented using a singly linked structure with head and tail references.
All main operations run in O(1) time.
